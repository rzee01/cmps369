# Applying CSS

To view this exact application without any CSS-related adjustments, checkout the no-style branch:

```
git pull origin no-style
git checkout no-style
```

You can review the ejs - where you'll find that I've added class attributes to some of the html
element, an ID in the success page, and done a bit of dynamic class assignment in guess.ejs.

The guess.css file contains all the styling rules.
